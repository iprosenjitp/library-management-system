# Library Management API with Express, TypeScript & MongoDB
This is a RESTful API for managing a library system, built with Express.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB using Mongoose. It allows users to manage a collection of books and borrowing records, with robust schema validation, filtering, and business logic enforcement.

The project showcases real-world backend development practices including:

- Schema validation and custom error messages

- Business logic enforcement, such as availability control during borrow

- Aggregation pipelines for filtering and sorting

- Use of Mongoose static and instance methods

- Implementation of pre/post middleware hooks

- Filtering, sorting, and pagination features in book retrieval

This project is ideal for learning how to build a full-featured API backend with modern best practices using TypeScript and MongoDB.

## Key Features:
- **Book Management**
    - Create, retrieve, and list books

    - Schema validation with required fields

    - Genre-based filtering and dynamic sorting using query parameters

    - Book availability status auto-updates when copies run out

- **Borrowing System**
    - Borrow books with quantity and due date

    - Validates if requested quantity is available

    - Automatically deducts borrowed copies and updates availability

    - Ensures referential integrity with book references

- **Mongoose Features**

    - Schema validation rules

    - Business logic via instance/static methods

    - Middleware (pre/post hooks) for post-borrow updates

    - Aggregation pipeline for filtered/sorted book queries
